# Recipes - The Odin Project
This is a repo for my recipe project (a standard example for the Odin Project).

Here is a link to the live page: https://bagrisham.github.io/odin-recipe/

Yes, it is not very pretty, but the idea was simply to showcase that I know these concepts:

1. That I can serve everything on GitHub
2. HTML Elements and Tags
3. HTML Boilerplate
4. Text centering, Headings, etc.
5. Lists (both Organized and Unorganized)
6. Anchor Links, Hyperlinks and Images (static, gifs and embedded i-frame video)
7. Commit Messages for GitHub

Ultimately, this was just to throw me back into web-dev cycle (and get my feet wet with GitHub again).
I did more than the bare-minimum, but this is all a training exercise anyway.

Thanks for reading this (if you actually care enough).
